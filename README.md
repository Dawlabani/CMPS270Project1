Thank you so much for your consistent help and consideration during this project.

In terms of the code, it's divided into generalized methods that will be used by most of the game's functionality. There was a special focus on probabilistic methods, and each mode has its own variation within it to account for different difficulty levels. Various comments have been added throughout to explain lengthy parts.

Please note that the report has been split into two parts\'97the report and the test specification document for ease of reading. 

Thank you again--please contact us on cjd06@mail.aub.edu should you have any queries.

Best,
The Phoenix Team
