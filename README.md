Dear TA team,

Thank you so much for your consistent help and consideration during this project.

In terms of the code, it's divided into generalized methods that will be used by most of the game's functionality. There was a special focus on probabilistic methods, and each mode has its own variation within it to account for different difficulty levels. Various comments have been added throughout.

Please note that the report has been split into two parts--the report and the test specification document for ease of reading. 

If a certain method feels confusing, please refer to the specifications document for a description.

Thank you again--please contact us on cjd06@mail.aub.edu should you have any queries.

Best,
The Phoenix Team
